We will try Google's [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) in the same way as "[Using llama-cpp-python to generate text with a local LLM and set up an OpenAI-compatible server](/entries/770)".

### Installing llama-cpp-python

First, create a venv.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/work/llm
cd $HOME/work/llm
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install llama-cpp-python. Install the server as well.

```
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_METAL=on" pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir 'llama-cpp-python[server]'
```

> ℹ️ If you encounter an error on an Apple Silicon Mac, please try the setup at https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/blob/main/docs/install/macos.md.

`chat_format="gemma"` is supported as of the following commit, so please use v0.2.48 or above.

https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/commit/251a8a2cadb4c0df4671062144d168a7874086a2


### Downloading Gemma


```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/models
sudo chown -R $USER /opt/models
```

Since the 7B model is large in file size, we will download the 2B model.

https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b/tree/main

Please download `gemma-2b.gguf` to `/opt/models/`.

### Launching the OpenAI-Compatible Server

Launch the server with the following command. You need to specify `--chat_format=gemma`.

```
python3 -m llama_cpp.server --chat_format=gemma --model /opt/models/gemma-2b-it.gguf --n_gpu_layers 1
```

You can check the API documentation here.

http://localhost:8000/docs


> While OpenAI's ["Create chat completion" API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) requires the `model` parameter, <br>
> it seems that the `model` parameter is not necessary for llama-cpp-python.

#### Accessing via curl

```
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
   "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a joke."}
   ]
 }' | jq .
```

A joke was returned.

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-79f5ae4c-cf47-494c-a82c-a7e3747ab463",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1708846379,
  "model": "/opt/models/gemma-2b-it.gguf",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "Why did the scarecrow win an award?\n\nBecause he was outstanding in his field!",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 14,
    "completion_tokens": 18,
    "total_tokens": 32
  }
}
```


```
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
   "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"}
   ]
 }' | jq .
```

It seems to work in Japanese as well.

      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "The capital of Japan is Tokyo. Tokyo is located in the eastern part of Japan and is a city that represents Japan.",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 14,
    "completion_tokens": 22,
    "total_tokens": 36
  }
}
```

#### Accessing from Spring AI

Let's access it from an app using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html).
Since it's OpenAI-compatible, you can use Spring AI's [Chat Client for OpenAI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/clients/openai-chat.html).

Here is a sample app.<br>
https://github.com/making/hello-spring-ai

```
git clone https://github.com/making/hello-spring-ai
cd hello-spring-ai
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests=true
java -jar target/hello-spring-ai-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.ai.openai.base-url=http://localhost:8000 --spring.ai.openai.api-key=dummy
```


```
$ curl localhost:8080
What do you call a boomerang that won't come back?

A stick.
```

This app itself is for OpenAI, but the fact that you can use Gemma just by changing the properties is an advantage of using llama-cpp-python.
