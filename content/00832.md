This is a note on relocating Helm Charts along with their images.

We will use the Helm plugin "[Distribution Tooling for Helm](https://github.com/vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm)".

I tested it with the following Helm version.

```
$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.16.3", GitCommit:"cfd07493f46efc9debd9cc1b02a0961186df7fdf", GitTreeState:"dirty", GoVersion:"go1.23.3"}
```

Install "Distribution Tooling for Helm".

```
helm plugin install https://github.com/vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm
```

I tested it with the following version.

```
$ helm dt version
Distribution Tooling for Helm v0.4.3
Built on: 2024-09-17T09:13:12Z
```

You can package an existing Helm Chart, including images, into a tar.gz file using the `helm dt wrap` command. The command arguments are as follows.

```
helm dt wrap CHART_PATH|OCI_URI [flags]
```

As an example, I would like to relocate https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/contour/19.3.2/bitnami/contour to GHCR.

> [!NOTE] To relocate the images, you need to enumerate the definitions of `image` in the `annotations` of `Chart.yaml` as shown in https://github.com/vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-an-images-lock. The Bitnami Helm Chart has this annotation set.

Specify version 19.3.2 and compress it into a tar.gz file.

```
helm dt wrap oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/contour --version 19.3.2
```

The following log will be output.

```

    ✔  Compressed into "/tmp/contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz"                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    
 🎉  Helm chart wrapped into "/tmp/contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz"
```

The file size is large because it contains images.

```
$ ls -lh contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz
-rw-r--r--  1 toshiaki  wheel   377M 12 11 10:08 contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz
```

You can check the contents of the packaged Chart with the `helm dt info` command.

```
$ helm dt info contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz 
 »  Wrap Information
       Chart: contour
       Version: 19.3.2

```

If you want to relocate it to an air-gapped environment, you can copy this tar.gz file using a USB memory or something similar.

Now, let's relocate this to GHCR. First, log in to GHCR.

```
docker login ghcr.io
```

Relocate using the `helm dt unwrap` command.

```
helm dt unwrap contour-19.3.2.wrap.tgz ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts --yes
```

The following log will be output.

```

 🎉  Helm chart unwrapped successfully: You can use it now by running "helm install oci://ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/contour --generate-name"
```

When generating YAML using the relocated Chart, you can see that the `image` has changed to GHCR.

```
$ helm template contour oci://ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/contour --version 19.3.2 2>/dev/null | grep 'image: '
          image: ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/bitnami/contour:1.30.1-debian-12-r3
          image: ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/bitnami/envoy:1.31.3-debian-12-r1
          image: ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/bitnami/contour:1.30.1-debian-12-r3
          image: ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/bitnami/contour:1.30.1-debian-12-r3
          image: ghcr.io/making/bitnamicharts/bitnami/contour:1.30.1-debian-12-r3
```

The images relocated this time have been made public, so you can check them from the following link.
