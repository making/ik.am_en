I will take notes on how to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) with Spring Security.

Since this implementation is limited to two factors, I will explicitly refer to it as 2FA rather than multi-factor authentication (MFA).

When you Google "Spring Security 2FA," you will find the following two examples:

* https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-two-factor-authentication-with-soft-token
* https://www.javadevjournal.com/spring-security/two-factor-authentication-with-spring-security/

Both implement 2FA using TOTP. However, they require the authentication code to be entered within the login form.
What I want to implement is:

* Only enter the username and password in the login form
* After successfully logging in with the username and password, if 2FA is enabled, display the authentication code (TOTP) input form

This flow cannot be achieved with the above implementation methods.

There is an official sample maintained by the Spring Security team that implements this flow.<br>
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-samples/blob/main/servlet/spring-boot/java/authentication/username-password/mfa <br>
This sample is an example of MFA.

A sample that implements the above flow based on this sample can be found at <br>
https://github.com/making/demo-two-factor-authentication/tree/main <br>

### Walkthrough of the Sample App
First, let's walk through the sample app.

Access http://localhost:8080/signup and register an account.

2FA is disabled by default.

Log out.

Log in again.

Since 2FA is disabled, you can log in successfully with just the username and password.

Enable 2FA.

2FA is now enabled.

This time, since 2FA is enabled, you will be prompted to enter the code.

### Explanation of the Implementation

The definition of `SecurityFilterChain` is as follows.

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http,
		AuthenticationSuccessHandler primarySuccessHandler) throws Exception {
	return http
		.authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
				.requestMatchers("/signup", "/error").permitAll()
				.requestMatchers("/challenge/totp").access(new TwoFactorAuthorizationManager())
				.anyRequest().authenticated())
		.formLogin(form -> form
			.successHandler(new TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler("/challenge/totp", primarySuccessHandler)))
		.securityContext(securityContext -> securityContext.requireExplicitSave(false))
		.build();
}
```

The key point is the `TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler` set in the `successHandler` of `formLogin`.
This class is responsible for "displaying the authentication code (TOTP) input form if 2FA is enabled after successfully logging in with the username and password."

The implementation is as follows.

```java
public class TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler {

	private final AuthenticationSuccessHandler primarySuccessHandler;

	private final AuthenticationSuccessHandler secondarySuccessHandler;

	public TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler(String secondAuthUrl,
			AuthenticationSuccessHandler primarySuccessHandler) {
		this.primarySuccessHandler = primarySuccessHandler;
		this.secondarySuccessHandler = new SimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler(secondAuthUrl);
	}

	@Override
	public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
			Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {
		AccountUserDetails accountUserDetails = (AccountUserDetails) authentication.getPrincipal();
		Account account = accountUserDetails.getAccount();
		if (account.twoFactorEnabled()) {
			SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(new TwoFactorAuthentication(authentication));
			this.secondarySuccessHandler.onAuthenticationSuccess(request, response, authentication);
		}
		else {
			this.primarySuccessHandler.onAuthenticationSuccess(request, response, authentication);
		}
	}

}
```

The `primarySuccessHandler` is the same as the default `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` (`SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler`). The `secondarySuccessHandler` is an `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` that redirects to the specified URL (in this case, `/challenge/totp`) upon successful login.

When the username and password are entered in the login form and authentication is successful, the `onAuthenticationSuccess` method of `TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler` is called.
As you can see from this method, if 2FA is disabled for the authenticated account, the process is delegated to the `primarySuccessHandler`. In other words, it proceeds as if 2FA is not used.
If 2FA is enabled, `TwoFactorAuthentication` is set in the `SecurityContext`, and the process is delegated to the `secondarySuccessHandler`. As a result, it redirects to `/challenge/totp`.

`TwoFactorAuthentication` is implemented as follows.

```java
public class TwoFactorAuthentication extends AbstractAuthenticationToken {

	private final Authentication primary;

	public TwoFactorAuthentication(Authentication primary) {
		super(List.of());
		this.primary = primary;
	}

	// omitted

	@Override
	public boolean isAuthenticated() {
		return false;
	}

	public Authentication getPrimary() {
		return this.primary;
	}
}
```

It wraps the `Authentication` object created through the actual authentication process (implementation is `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`), but `isAuthenticated` returns `false`. In other words, it is in an unauthenticated state.
If 2FA is enabled, even if the login with the username and password is successful, it will not be in an "authenticated" state, so it will not be authorized for `anyRequest().authenticated()`.
On the other hand, the next destination `/challenge/totp` needs to be authorized, so the setting `.requestMatchers("/challenge/totp").access(new TwoFactorAuthorizationManager())` is used.

The implementation of `TwoFactorAuthorizationManager` is as follows.

```java
public class TwoFactorAuthorizationManager implements AuthorizationManager<RequestAuthorizationContext> {

	@Override
	public AuthorizationDecision check(Supplier<Authentication> authentication, RequestAuthorizationContext object) {
		return new AuthorizationDecision(authentication.get() instanceof TwoFactorAuthentication);
	}

}
```

It only checks whether the target `Authentication` object is `TwoFactorAuthentication`. Therefore, it is authorized when redirected to `/challenge/totp` by `TwoFactorAuthenticationSuccessHandler`.

The Controller for `/challenge/totp` is as follows.

```java
@Controller
public class TwoFactorAuthController {

	private final TwoFactorAuthenticationCodeVerifier codeVerifier;

	private final AuthenticationSuccessHandler successHandler;

	private final AuthenticationFailureHandler failureHandler;
	
	// omitted

	@GetMapping(path = "/challenge/totp")
	public String requestTotp() {
		return "totp";
	}

	@PostMapping(path = "/challenge/totp")
	public void processTotp(@RequestParam String code, TwoFactorAuthentication authentication,
			HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		Authentication primaryAuthentication = authentication.getPrimary();
		AccountUserDetails accountUserDetails = (AccountUserDetails) primaryAuthentication.getPrincipal();
		Account account = accountUserDetails.getAccount();
		if (this.codeVerifier.verify(account, code)) {
			SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(primaryAuthentication);
			this.successHandler.onAuthenticationSuccess(request, response, primaryAuthentication);
		}
		else {
			this.failureHandler.onAuthenticationFailure(request, response, new BadCredentialsException("Invalid code"));
		}
	}

}
```

`GET /challenge/totp` only displays the form to enter the code. For `POST /challenge/totp`, it verifies the TOTP code with `TwoFactorAuthenticationCodeVerifier`.

If the code is valid, it sets the original authenticated `Authentication` in the `SecurityContext` and processes the success with the default `AuthenticationSuccessHandler`.
If the code is not valid, it processes the login failure with the default `AuthenticationFailureHandler`.

The generation and verification of the TOTP secret, as well as the generation of the QR code, are omitted in this article. Please check the source code on GitHub.

> [Note] From Spring Security 6, simply using `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(...)` no longer saves the session state by default, and you need to explicitly save the context.<br>
> Although there are disadvantages, we set `securityContext.requireExplicitSave(false)` so that explicit context saving is not necessary in this case.<br>
