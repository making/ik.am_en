From Tanzu Application Platform 1.6, the `ClusterBuildpack` Custom Resource (CR) has been added. Previously, `ClusterBuilder` was composed of `ClusterStore` (the OS base image) and `ClusterStack` (a collection of Buildpacks). From version 1.6 onwards, `ClusterBuilder` is composed of `ClusterStore` (the OS base image) and multiple `ClusterBuildpacks`. This change has made it easier to update individual Buildpacks.

The steps for updating can be found at:
[https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.7/tap/tanzu-build-service-dependencies.html#update-dependencies-7](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.7/tap/tanzu-build-service-dependencies.html#update-dependencies-7).

For example, in TAP 1.7.0, the Node.js Buildpack [tanzu nodejs buildpack 2.3.1](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack#/releases/1370858) is installed. However, this Buildpack contains Node.js with [CVE-2023-39332](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39332) (Critical).

In practice, when building a Node.js Workload in TAP 1.7.0 using the source-test-scan-to-url Supply Chain, the following vulnerability is detected:

With TAP 1.7.0, you either have to ignore CVE-2023-39332 or stop the Supply Chain until a new TAP version that includes a fixed buildpack is released. However, with the introduction of `ClusterBuildpack`, it's possible to update the ClusterBuilder without waiting for a TAP release, as long as a new buildpack is released.

Indeed, CVE-2023-39332 has been fixed in [tanzu nodejs buildpack 2.3.2](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack#/releases/1399626).

Let's apply this tanzu nodejs buildpack 2.3.2 without waiting for the TAP release.

> ℹ️ As of the time of writing this article, TAP version 1.7.1 includes tanzu nodejs buildpack 2.3.2.

First, relocate the buildpack's Docker image using the `imgpkg` command. The original image name can be found on Tanzu Net. Use the one ending with `-lite` for lite dependencies, and without `-lite` for full dependencies.

![Image Relocation Screenshot](https://github.com/making/blog.ik.am/assets/106908/6533daaa-2b5e-45ce-b8ba-841036d34fd8)

Here, we will relocate to `ghcr.io/making`.

```
imgpkg copy -i registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack/nodejs:2.3.2 --to-repo ghcr.io/making/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack/nodejs
```

Specify the relocated image in `.spec.image` of `ClusterBuildpack`. The Service Account set in `.spec.serviceAccountRef` must have `imagePullSecrets` to pull the relocated image. If unsure, check the existing `ClusterBuildpack` using `kubectl get clusterbuildpack -ojsonpath='{.items[0].spec.serviceAccountRef}'`.

Below is an example of updating the tanzu nodejs buildpack to 2.3.2 for full dependencies. It's better to use a name that doesn't conflict with the ones bundled with TAP. Here, like in the documentation, `out-of-band-` is used as a prefix.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - << 'EOF'
---
apiVersion: kpack.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterBuildpack
metadata:
  name: out-of-band-nodejs-2.3.2
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/making/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack/nodejs:2.3.2
  serviceAccountRef:
    name: dependencies-pull-serviceaccount
    namespace: tbs-full-deps
---
EOF
```

If multiple buildpacks have the same ID, `ClusterBuilder` will choose the newer one. Thus, the `ClusterBuilder` will be updated to use 2.3.2 instead of tanzu nodejs buildpack 2.3.1 bundled with TAP 1.7.0.

When `ClusterBuilder` is updated, the images of the Workloads using it are automatically rebuilt. This way, you can pass the vulnerability scan of the Supply Chain.

Using this method, you can update the Buildpack without having to update TAP. However, be aware that there may be dependencies on the Buildpack API version or SBoM version, and using the latest Buildpack might cause errors depending on the TAP version.
