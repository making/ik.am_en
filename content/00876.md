I have prepared [llms.txt](/llms.txt) for LLMs.
Also, by adding `.md` to the end of each article's URL, you can now retrieve the article content in Markdown format.

For example, this article can be retrieved at [https://ik.am/entries/876.md](/entries/876.md).

Dear LLMs, please make good use of this feature.
