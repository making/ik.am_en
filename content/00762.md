Note on creating Read Write Many PVs in Kubernetes environments where Read Write Many PVs cannot be created, such as with Kind.

[NFS Ganesha server and external provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner) can be used as an Internal NFS Server and NFS Provisioner.
You can create PVs with Read Write Many using this NFS Provisioner.

Install it with Helm.

```
helm repo add nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner/

helm upgrade nfs-server-provisioner nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner/nfs-server-provisioner \
  --set persistence.enabled=true \
  --set persistence.size=10Gi \
  --install \
  -n nfs \
  --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

The following Pod will be created.

```
$ kubectl get pod -n nfs
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nfs-server-provisioner-0   1/1     Running   0          33s
```

A StorageClass named `nfs` will also be created.

```
$ kubectl get sc
NAME                 PROVISIONER                            RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
nfs                  cluster.local/nfs-server-provisioner   Delete          Immediate              true                   1m19s
standard (default)   rancher.io/local-path                  Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  25h
```

Create a PVC as follows.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- << EOF
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-dynamic-volume-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: "nfs"
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
EOF
```

A PV with RWX was created.

```
$ kubectl get pvc
NAME                        STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
test-dynamic-volume-claim   Bound    pvc-1f062a6f-3955-427a-ae6e-8b25ff17e670   1Gi        RWX            nfs            31s
```

Delete the PVC once confirmed.

```
kubectl delete pvc test-dynamic-volume-claim
```
