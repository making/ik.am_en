There are many configuration mistakes with Spring's [`TaskScheduler`](https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-framework/5.0.x/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#scheduling), particularly with the commonly used `org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`.

* `corePoolSize`
* `maxPoolSize`
* `queueCapacity`

These are the configuration items.

At first glance, it might seem that the order in which this `Executor` creates `Threads` is:

1. Create `Threads` up to `corePoolSize` first
2. When `corePoolSize` is full, increase `Threads` up to `maxPoolSize`
3. When `maxPoolSize` is exceeded, queue up to `queueCapacity`
4. When `queueCapacity` is exceeded, reject

However, this is a misunderstanding.

The correct order is:

1. Create `Threads` up to `corePoolSize`
2. When `corePoolSize` is full, queue up to `queueCapacity`
3. When `queueCapacity` is exceeded, increase `Threads` up to `maxPoolSize`
4. When `maxPoolSize` is exceeded, reject

The default value for `corePoolSize` is `1`, and for both `maxPoolSize` and `queueCapacity`, the default value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

The following configuration is meaningless:

``` java
@Bean
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor threadPoolTaskExecutor() {
	ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
	taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(4);
	taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(40);
	return taskExecutor;
}
```

Since `queueCapacity` is not set, the maximum number of threads is `4`. All requests beyond that will be queued. The number `40` is meaningless.

``` java
@Bean
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor threadPoolTaskExecutor() {
	ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
	taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(40);
	return taskExecutor;
}
```

Since neither `corePoolSize` nor `queueCapacity` is set, the maximum number of threads is `1`. All requests beyond that will be queued.

If you want to set the number of threads to `4`-`40`, you need to configure it as follows (note that this does not mean that 4 threads will be created initially):

``` java
@Bean
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor threadPoolTaskExecutor() {
	ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
	taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(4);
	taskExecutor.setQueueCapacity(4);
	taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(40);
	return taskExecutor;
}
```

It is less confusing to recognize the configuration values in the following order:

* `corePoolSize`
* `queueCapacity`
* `maxPoolSize`

Alternatively, if you only want to specify that the maximum number of threads is `40`, you can do so with:

``` java
@Bean
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor threadPoolTaskExecutor() {
	ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
	taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(40);
	return taskExecutor;
}
```

By the way, when creating the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` that `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` delegates to, it is often used as follows:

``` java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(40);
```

This is similar to:

``` java
@Bean
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor threadPoolTaskExecutor() {
	ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
	taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(40);
	taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(40);
	return taskExecutor;
}
```

If you intuitively want to increase `Threads` first, consider using riptide-concurrent as follows:<br>
