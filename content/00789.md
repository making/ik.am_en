Notes on reducing disk usage as the Node became Disk Full. Specifically, I want to delete unused container images.

Use the `kubectl debug` command to access the Node.

```
kubectl debug node/<node_name> -it --image=busybox
```

Start interaction with the node session using `chroot`.

```
chroot /host
```

Check the disk size. It's at 100% usage.

```
$ df -h | head -3
Filesystem                                 Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda2                                  150G  148G     0 100% /
tmpfs                                      3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm
```

Install [`nerdctl`](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl), a docker CLI for containerd, on the Node.

```
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v1.7.6/nerdctl-1.7.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzvf nerdctl-1.7.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz 
mv nerdctl /usr/local/bin/
```

Run `nerdctl version` to confirm access to the containerd server.

```
$ nerdctl version

```

Check the container images accumulated on the Node.

```
nerdctl --namespace k8s.io images
```

Unused images are likely taking up disk space.

Use the following command to delete all images. Images that are in use and running cannot be deleted, so only unused images will be removed.

```
nerdctl --namespace k8s.io images | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq | xargs nerdctl --namespace k8s.io rmi -f
```

The disk usage has slightly recovered.

```
$ df -h  | head -3 
Filesystem                                 Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda2                                  150G  117G   27G  82% /
tmpfs                                      3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm
```

Execute `exit` twice to terminate.

```
$ kubectl get pod                                               
NAME                                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
node-debugger-kiwi-build-0e46b92bc3b6-nvpg5   0/1     Completed   0          8m7s
```

The debug pod remains in a `Completed` state, so feel free to delete it if it's unnecessary.
